            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER FROM <hi>SOME-BODY</hi> in the Country.</head>
            <p>GOod Mr. <hi>No-Body,</hi> I have thoughr fit to bring you a Cordial to your Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, lest the mighty Surfeit should im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair your Airy Concavity, or drown your dabling fancy in a maze of unlucky thoughts, whereby sad desperations might arise, and Tempests toss your Genius beyond what Nature is capable of sustaining; for many there are of your Profession, who in their <hi>Pericranium</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:64404:3"/>have continual Turnings, Whirlwinds, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testine Wars: Reason and Ignorance contend for Superiority, and oftentimes distract, or with an Inundation overflow their bounds, and fall foul upon their Neighbouring Territories; for plainly I must tell you Mr. <hi>No-Body,</hi> whether in City or Country, in Town Corporate, Cinque-Port, or Village, or in what place soever I find you, I shall note you as an idle fantastical Fellow, delighting in scandals, reproaches, back-bitings, and a thousand Enormities: from whence you derived your being, none but your self can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the wandering shade of a grim Gobling, who plays least in sight, scouting from place to place, lest any should observe your Knavish Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambulation, or meet you at half bent; and if at any time you are trapped in your Roguery, then immediately to clear your self, you cry out upon me, and say, <hi>Some-Body</hi> enticed you to act such under-hand mischiefs, when your self was the Primitive Author; for you being an old Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of <hi>Fames,</hi> she fills your head with Proclamations, and puts you to relate things which never were transacted; the which long suming from your parboiled brains, at last breaks out into an open blaze, to the prejudice of many an honest man: but when they look for the Promoter of the Slander, you are not to be found, then presently I am taxed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as guilty of the Embrion Crime, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64404:3"/>Birth, the which had its immature being from your spurious fancy; when at the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant that it first took being, I was imploid in Nobler Concernments, about State Affairs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Government, propagation of Religious Exercises, and the like; the which if <hi>Some-body</hi> did not maintain, 'twould inevitably sink, and fall to ruine: And as you take that Arrogance upon you to tax me with Perjuries, Frauds, Thefts, Treasons, and a thousand more of your pernicious and dangerous Villanies. I take Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to witness, that I have endeavoured to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press such Vices, and to settle the Christal streams of Virtue in a peaceful Land; and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose horrid Wars, Intestine and Clandestine Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, depress Rebellious Miscreants; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever was pleasing and delightful, by <hi>Some-Body</hi> were cherish'd and maintained. And likewise let me tell you Mr. <hi>No-Body,</hi> that Heaven takes such delight in <hi>Some-Body,</hi> and <hi>Some-Bodies</hi> pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Exercises, that it thought fit to bestow all the Graces and Priviledges upon <hi>Some-Body</hi> for the same, that was capable to bear.</p>
            <p>Therefore Mr. <hi>No-Body,</hi> by your leave, I must tell you, it was an insufferable piece of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in you to Father Blushing Crimes upon me, and thus fully my Candid Reputation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cause, casting your vile aspersion upon so honourable a Person; a Person, that were it not that I scorn to be concerned with so inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64404:4"/>a Fellow as you in all probability are, I should make you know me better: For take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, it is not for want of strength and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I decline you, and suffer thus your Erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Scandals and Exclamations; for <hi>Some-Body</hi> durst venture upon the <hi>Rump-Parliament,</hi> and turn them out of the House for non-payment of Rent; and <hi>Some-Body</hi> it was that fetched away old <hi>Noll</hi> in a Whirlwind, and shook him whilst three Kingdoms dropped from his Topesanday. And likewise after the remove of that Usurper, it was <hi>Some-Body</hi> that happily restored his now Sacred Majesty, after his so long and unjust Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilement, and placed him in his established Throne, against which let <hi>No-body</hi> dare to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose himself, lest Divine Vengeance stop his Hell-bred malice with Eternal Flames.</p>
            <p>And since the blessed Restoration of our <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Monarchy, and the depression of antick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouthed Fanaticks, whose Vinegar-Faces set peoples Teeth on edge, <hi>Some-Body</hi> has maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Laws and Liberties, propagated the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of the (before decaying) Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>And likewise <hi>Some-Body</hi> was instrumental in the discovery of the late hellish Plot, so secretly and subtilly contrived, that all the art of Men or Devils could not do more; yet you have the impudence to tax me as guilty of that most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred sin, the which had not <hi>Some-Body</hi> timely prevented; had ruined both Church and State,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64404:4"/>for all stood tottering on the fatal brink: But Heaven made <hi>Some-Body</hi> so happy as to find out and discover the growing mischief before it was ripened or come to perfection; for which <hi>Some-Body</hi> was well rewarded by his most loving and bounteous Prince, for so good and great a work, at which let <hi>No-Body</hi> repine. And likewise since by <hi>Some-Bodie</hi>'s good Instructions several of those Locusts that lately ascended out of the bottomless Pit, have been sent back again to their primitive Dwelling, e're they could finish their tripple-stingg'd Masters business, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the so long contriv'd task.</p>
            <p>And likewise <hi>Rome</hi>'s Dictator is by <hi>Some-Body</hi> probably conjectured to be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, for <hi>No Body</hi> believes that the Keys of his Money-Chest will open Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial dwellings, or that he can let roast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Souls out of smoaky <hi>Avernus</hi> for <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> dust; therefore <hi>No-Body</hi> is such a Fool to trust him with his Eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness. But <hi>Some-Body</hi> knows he is not able to save himself in the great and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble day, in that day when <hi>Heaven and Earth and all the Elements shall pass away, and melt with fervent heat,</hi> Then <hi>No-Body</hi> will find <hi>Rome</hi>'s Dictates. But
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64404:5"/>if <hi>Some-Body</hi> should then call for the Pope, and desire his Warrants to justifie them before the Ancient of Days, he will not appear, <hi>No-Body</hi> can produce him. Himself will not know in what place to hide himself, when he shall be called to an account for all the innocent blood his hands have shed.</p>
            <p>Therefore let <hi>No Body</hi> trust a finite Being with the limits of Infinite mercy, lest in the mid-way to Salvation his laging wings cloged with the camps of mighty errours, should decline again, and instead of everlasting rest mistake the way, and plunge incircling fires, of which dread event <hi>Some-Body</hi> is always so wary as to avoid; and certainly <hi>No-Body</hi> will be so rash as to press violently upon premeditate destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on if any by accident do; <hi>No-Body</hi> but himself must answer for so dangerous an attempt. This from <hi>Some-Body,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires the hatred of <hi>No-Body.</hi>
